# Stats 418: Tools in Data Science

[Stats 418](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/Public/SOC/Results/ClassDetail?term_cd=19S&subj_area_cd=STATS%20%20&crs_catlg_no=0418%20%20%20%20&class_id=663636200&class_no=%20001%20%20) is a graduate level statistics course restricted to UCLA Masters in Applied Statistics students. The course will present current tools for data acquisition, transformation and analysis, data visualization, and machine learning and tools for reproducible data analysis, collaboration, and model deployment used by data scientists in practice. Advanced R packages and Python libraries, analytical databases, high-performance machine learning libraries, big data tools. 

## Course Description
Data Science has been vaguely defined and re-defined for the good part of the past decade with, but has long history in both statistics and computing. What is clear is that the necessary 'tools' for a Data Scientist are changing at an incredbily rapid rate deeming a course exclusivley focusing on these tool a necessity. The prerequisites of this course, Data Management and Statistical Computing in addition to the other courses in the MAS program provide a solid base   The overall course will present a large breadth of topics but all under the overarching goal of building a data product (something akin to taking a data science project from conception to completion through deployment). These topics will all mirror things that are being used currently in industry by the best Data Scientists from unicorn startups to fortune 500 companies. Much of it will be applied in a learning-by-doing fashion while being presented with the resources to dive in when a topic necessitates it.

## Key Dates

Problem set due dates will be announced as each problem set is distributed. 

Other important deadlines and dates during the term are: 

* TBD data/proposal slide submissions
* Student data/proposal presentations (Week 6)
* TBD Final slide submissions
* Student final presentations (Week 10)

## Resources

Papers will be posted in the corresponding weekly directory. There is no textbook.

## Evaluation

### Problem Sets

Working on actual problems is central to learning. Four problem sets will be assigned, on alternating weeks. These assignments will consist of analytical problems, computer simulations, and data analysis. Late submissions will not be accepted. Assignment will generally be made available by Tuesdays and due two Tuesdays later prior to lecture. All sufficiently attempted homework (ie. a typed and well organized write-up with all problems attempted) will be graded on a (+,âœ“,-) scale. Students are encouraged to discuss the problems together, but must independently produce and submit solutions. Work should be done as a RMarkdown file or a Jupyter notebook and committed to GitHub. 

### Final Project

A final project will be completed as individuals. The project will encourage collaboration, test your data acquisition skills, use your predictive modeling, challenge your programming ability and promote presenting skills. A proposal presentation with an acquired dataset, exploratory data analysis, and future direction with be presented during week 6.  In addition, each individual will also present their work to the class during the final week of the quarter. Effective verbal communication is a critical skill for data scientist, and it requires practice and feedback to develop. Additional information about the final project will given as the course progresses, including the grading rubric.
