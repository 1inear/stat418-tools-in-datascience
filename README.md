# Stats 418: Tools in Data Science

[Stats 418](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/Public/SOC/Results/ClassDetail?term_cd=19S&subj_area_cd=STATS%20%20&crs_catlg_no=0418%20%20%20%20&class_id=663636200&class_no=%20001%20%20) is a graduate level statistics course restricted to UCLA Masters in Applied Statistics students. The course will present current tools for data acquisition, transformation and analysis, data visualization, and machine learning and tools for reproducible data analysis, collaboration, and model deployment used by data scientists in practice. Advanced R packages and Python libraries, analytical databases, high-performance machine learning libraries, big data tools. 

## Course Description


## Key Dates

Problem set due dates will be announced as each problem set is distributed. 

Other important deadlines and dates during the term are: 

* TBD Final slide submissions
* TBD Student presentations (Week 10)

## Resources

Papers will be posted in the corresponding weekly directory.

## Evaluation

### Problem Sets

Working on actual problems is central to learning. Four problem sets will be assigned, on alternating weeks. These assignments will consist of analytical problems, computer simulations, and data analysis. Late submissions will not be accepted. Assignment will generally be made available by Tuesdays and due two Tuesdays later prior to lecture. All sufficiently attempted homework (ie. a typed and well organized write-up with all problems attempted) will be graded on a (+,âœ“,-) scale. Students are encouraged to discuss the problems together, but must independently produce and submit solutions. Work should be done as a RMarkdown file or a Jupyter notebook and committed to GitHub.
